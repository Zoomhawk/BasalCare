# <a href="https://basal-care.vercel.app/"> BasalCare</a>
## What our website does?
BasalCare is a website that solves the much bigger issues in society which are not yet addressed. BasalCare alongwith other things largely focuses on minimizing the death rate by providing a quick and easy way of getting medical background of the patient which in turn helps doctors to ensure that only perfect medication is provided. Hence, the patients too receive right and on-time treatment. They won't die anymore due to lack of knowledge of background medication. BasalCare provides each patient with an id and also a QR code. Registered and verified hospitals only can access the patient's details using scanning the QR code. Hence, quick registration and medication can be provided to patients without any form - filling delay or queue delay.
Additionally, our website reminds you of your appointments and also reminds you of your medicine routine via email.


## How is it different?
It is an universal website which provides hospitals the details of the patient in one QR scan. There is no need to fill the form. Unlike other hospital websites, they have the information of their own patients only and use them only at their organization. BasalCare is a universal website where each registered and verified hospital can register and access the patient's data. Hospitals will also add the treatment and detailed report of the patient in the website which will keep our site updated as well.
It will be very helpful whenever an emergency case comes to hospital. Treatment can be started immediately without any useless delay which can risk someone's life.


## Business model
Like other business models totally depend on fee-for-service revenue, BasalCare does not charge any fee for that. Instead, BasalCare will provide cards to its users just like Aadhar card or Pan Card where a QR code will be there which can retrieve all its information. BasalCare will have a annual charge of the card. People will do buy this card because it is very helpful for all of them as it ensures that they get right medication.

On the other hand, we have a revenue system for hospitals too. BasalCare eases the patient admission load and tedious form filling procedure which will help them in a smooth onboarding process, thereby reducing there expenses. We have an annual charge scheme for the hospitals too. 
 
## Future Aspirations
It will also encorporate the patient's health insurance details which does not require him/her to provide again and again same details on every hospital. This type of website would also be very useful and great advantage if the goverment runs this type of websites. It will help to encorporate all the government hospitals as well whose treatment levels are very less which is also the main problem in Indian Healthcare.


## Why does it come under sustainable growth?
Sustainable growth means growth that is repeatable, ethical and responsible to, and for, current and future communities.
It comes under sustainable growth because:
1.Lack of Infrastructure- No proper regulation to provide immediate doctor attention at any hospital. BasalCare is a perfect solution for this.
2.Unmanageable patient load- Healthcare facilities had been feeling the strain due to unmanageable patient-load. Moreover, serving a population of 1.4 billion remains a Herculean task in itself when it comes to suitably managing healthcare facilities. There is a need to adopt technology wherever possible to streamline the operational and clinical processes for healthcare facilities in order to manage efficient patient flow. BasalCare is again the perfect app for this.
3.Public health policy and proactive healthcare- Since healthcare system will greatly be benefitted with the app, both public health policy will be a procative healthcare and not a reactive healthcare.
4.Prevention of wrong treatment - Although doctors give their best, they can do nothing if they are kept uninformed of patient's medical background. It will help them to do right and accurate treatment and patients too will get better sooner.

## How does it add to improve the health and wellness sector?
Speeds up the process of admitting patients which has a much greater impact on emergency cases. Thus, treatment starts sooner and lives can be saved. Saving lives is the thing which health and wellness sector reallly aims to and BasalCare meet all its needs.




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
